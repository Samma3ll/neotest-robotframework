Yes, it should be possible to run tests with this basic adapter, but there are a few prerequisites to check first:

1. Make sure Robot Framework is installed and the `robot` command is available in your PATH:
```bash
robot --version
```

2. Ensure your Neovim configuration has Neotest and the adapter properly set up:

```lua
require("neotest").setup({
  adapters = {
    require("neotest-robotframework")
  }
})
```

3. Make sure you have a valid Robot Framework test file (`.robot` extension) open.

You can then try running tests using these Neotest commands:

```vim
" Run nearest test
:lua require("neotest").run.run()

" Run current file
:lua require("neotest").run.run(vim.fn.expand("%"))
```

If it's not working, we should:

1. Add some debug logging to verify the adapter is being called
2. Check if test positions are being discovered correctly
3. Verify the command being generated
